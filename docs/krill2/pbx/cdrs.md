# PBX | CDRs

It shows the incoming and outgoing calls' CDRs (call detail record) from the telephony service integrated in Krill.

The menu allows us to filter the calls based on different parameters such as: outgoing number, incoming number, call output (if it has been answered or not, if it was busy, if it failed...), date range and by CPEs.
