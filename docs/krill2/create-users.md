**Creating a User for Krill through the `/admin` Panel**

1.  Access the admin panel:

    To do this, we need to go to <https://XXX.phicus.es/admin> using the credentials we usually use for **Krill**.

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-login.png)

2.  Once inside, we will see this panel:

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-menu.png)

3.  We go to Users, where we can see all the users we have created:

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-users-list.png)

4.  At the top right, we can add a new user using "Add User":

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-add-user.png)

    This screen appears, where we must enter the Username and the password twice.

5.  Once we have created the user, we can manage the permissions:

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-change-user.png)

6.  After this, we must grant permissions to the corresponding realm, as the network can be divided into realms, and each of these has different visibility.

    Letâ€™s assume that the realm to be modified is the main and default one, called "cpe":

    ![](/img/admin-users/admin-change-realm.png)

Once we see this image, we need to enter the realm itself, in this case by clicking on "1", to manage the different users who have access to the realm:

![](/img/admin-users/admin-users-realm.png)

Here, we can insert the different users who have permission to view the CPE Realm. The process would be exactly the same for any realm.

**Explanation of Groups and Permissions in the Administration Panel**

**Groups**

**APP**

Applications are specific modules within your system that offer different functionalities. Each application handles a particular part of the system.

::: tip Example   
 - **APP inventory**: Manages everything related to inventory, such as products, stock, and goods in/out.
  - **APP voip**: Manages VoIP (Voice over IP) services, handling calls and voice communications over the Internet.
:::

**HG (Host Groups)**

Host groups are collections of devices or services managed together. These groups allow organizing and monitoring different components of the infrastructure.

::: tip Example
 - **HG CORE Servers**: Includes all the main servers of the system, essential for the network and services to function.  
 - **HG CORE Router**: Groups all central routers, crucial for data traffic management.
:::

**Realm**

Realms are specific domains within the system that group similar devices or services, facilitating their management and monitoring.

::: tip Example
 - **realm:cpeethernet**: Refers to the domain of CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) devices using Ethernet technology.  
 - **realm:swtdocsis**: Includes devices in the SWT Realm that use DOCSIS technology for data transmission over coaxial cable.

**Permissions**

**Permission Structure**

Each permission is presented in the format 'application | model | action'.  
 - **Application**: The part of the system where the permission is applied (e.g., account, admin).  
 - **Model**: The type of data or entity to which the permission applies (e.g., email address, user).  
 - **Action**: The operation that is allowed, such as add (add), change (change), delete (delete), or view (view).

**Permission Examples**

 - **account \| email address \| Can add email address**: Allows the user to add a new email address in the account application.  
 - **auth \| user \| Can change user**: Allows the user to modify other users' data in the authentication application.
 - **icingadb \| hostgroup \| Can monitor CORE Servers**: Allows the user to monitor the main servers in the CORE host group.  
 - **isp \| Customer \| Can view Customer**: Allows the user to view customer data in the ISP (Internet Service Provider) application.

**Functioning**

**Assigning Permissions**

Each user in your system can be assigned various permissions. These permissions determine what actions they can perform within the specific system applications.  
 - Example: A user with the 'Can view email address' permission can view email addresses but cannot modify or delete them.

**User Groups**

Users can be grouped into 'Groups' that have a common set of permissions. This facilitates permission management for multiple users who need the same accesses. Instead of assigning permissions individually to each user, they are assigned to a group, and users are added to this group.

::: tip Example
 - **Support Group**: Could have permissions such as 'Can view Customer' and 'Can view isp'. All users in the Support Group will inherit these permissions.  
 - **Administrators Group**: Would have broader permissions, such as 'Can add user', 'Can delete user', 'Can view all data', allowing full system management.
