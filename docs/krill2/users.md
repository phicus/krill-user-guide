# Krill2

## Usuarios

Krill's *temporary* module used to manage the users and their permissions, among other things.

It works like Kiwi in Krill's older verion, but it is not used to manage the registration or deregistration of the CPEs or customers, it's only used for users.

::: tip
It will be replaced soon with a module, that will be integrated in Krill 2, that will allow a complete management of the users, permission's groups, permissions, etc.
