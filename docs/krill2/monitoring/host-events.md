List of the events of all the hosts that Krill monitors. It usually includes the devices' IP concessions or TR069 sessions, the changes made in Krill's files, etc.

When the arrow icon at the left of each event is clicked, a complete report will be shown with all the information received.

When the date menu is displayed the time frame in which we want to see the sessions can be selected.
