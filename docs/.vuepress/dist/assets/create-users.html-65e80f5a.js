Each application handles a particular part of the system.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><ul><li><strong>APP inventory</strong>: Manages everything related to inventory, such as products, stock, and goods in/out.</li><li><strong>APP voip</strong>: Manages VoIP (Voice over IP) services, handling calls and voice communications over the Internet.</li></ul></div><p><strong>HG (Host Groups)</strong></p><p>Host groups are collections of devices or services managed together. These groups allow organizing and monitoring different components of the infrastructure.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><ul><li><strong>HG CORE Servers</strong>: Includes all the main servers of the system, essential for the network and services to function.</li><li><strong>HG CORE Router</strong>: Groups all central routers, crucial for data traffic management.</li></ul></div><p><strong>Realm</strong></p><p>Realms are specific domains within the system that group similar devices or services, facilitating their management and monitoring.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><ul><li><strong>realm:cpeethernet</strong>: Refers to the domain of CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) devices using Ethernet technology.</li><li><strong>realm:swtdocsis</strong>: Includes devices in the SWT Realm that use DOCSIS technology for data transmission over coaxial cable.</li></ul></div><p><strong>Permissions</strong></p><p><strong>Permission Structure</strong></p><p>Each permission is presented in the format &#39;application | model | action&#39;.</p><ul><li><strong>Application</strong>: The part of the system where the permission is applied (e.g., account, admin).</li><li><strong>Model</strong>: The type of data or entity to which the permission applies (e.g., email address, user).</li><li><strong>Action</strong>: The operation that is allowed, such as add (add), change (change), delete (delete), or view (view).</li></ul><p><strong>Permission Examples</strong></p><ul><li><strong>account | email address | Can add email address</strong>: Allows the user to add a new email address in the account application.</li><li><strong>auth | user | Can change user</strong>: Allows the user to modify other users&#39; data in the authentication application.</li><li><strong>icingadb | hostgroup | Can monitor CORE Servers</strong>: Allows the user to monitor the main servers in the CORE host group.</li><li><strong>isp | Customer | Can view Customer</strong>: Allows the user to view customer data in the ISP (Internet Service Provider) application.</li></ul><p><strong>Functioning</strong></p><p><strong>Assigning Permissions</strong></p><p>Each user in your system can be assigned various permissions. These permissions determine what actions they can perform within the specific system applications.</p><ul><li>Example: A user with the &#39;Can view email address&#39; permission can view email addresses but cannot modify or delete them.</li></ul><p><strong>User Groups</strong></p><p>Users can be grouped into &#39;Groups&#39; that have a common set of permissions. This facilitates permission management for multiple users who need the same accesses. Instead of assigning permissions individually to each user, they are assigned to a group, and users are added to this group.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Example</p><ul><li><strong>Support Group</strong>: Could have permissions such as &#39;Can view Customer&#39; and &#39;Can view isp&#39;.
