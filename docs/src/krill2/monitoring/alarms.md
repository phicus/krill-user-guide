# Monitoring | Alarms

Predefined search that returns the network's alarms generated by Krill ordered by the affectation level from the more to the least important. 

![MonitoringAlarms](@images/krill2/monitoring/0101.png)

::: tip
In the case of the Hosts it is considered alarm when they are **DOWN** and in the cae of serviceswhen their state is **CRITICAL**.
:::

The first search that will appear in the search bar on top will filter the results that are already under control (they have an **ACK** or **Downtime**), the ones whose state is considered **HARD** and whose **business impact** is greater than 2 or equal:  

```
alarm:true handled:false hard_state:true business_impact:>=2 type:all
```

At the top of the page we can select between Hosts and services with the selector that appears there. There's also another selector that allows us to change the result grouping rules by: Buisiness Impact, state y host.
