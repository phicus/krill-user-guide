- [CPE Profiles](/krill2/isp-customer/cpe-profiles): It is used for the different fares that can be applied to the CPEs depending on the technology; the same bap is used for GPON, WiMAX, Docsis y G.HN speeds.

::: tip CUSTOMERS â€“ CPEs bond

The CPE is what we call **subscriber's terminal** that allows the conectivity in the customer's house (they can be the WiMAX antennas, the GPON ONTs and the DOCSIS' CMs).
A  customer can have more than one CPE but a CPE can't belong to more than one customer at a time.
