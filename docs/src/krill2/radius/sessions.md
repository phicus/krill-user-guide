::: tip
From this list the session can be ended with the Disconnect Session button, it can be ended individually or if a lot of sessions are selected they can be ended at the same time.
:::

From the bar on the top, the sessions can be filtered automatically in different ways by clicking on the central menus:

- Active Sessions
- Duplicated Sessions
- Duplicated IP

The search bar allows us to search or filter sessions with any information on them.
