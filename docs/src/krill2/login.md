# Access

Krill's main view that can be used as the access page.

The **Krill2's** web interface (KrillUI) uses the HTTPS protocol and it it accesed through the following link:
- [https://XXX.phicus.es/login](https://XXX.phicus.es/login)

Where **XXX** represents the operator's 3 letters acronym given by the Phicus team.

For each customer a user and password will be needed:

- ***Username***: user's name.
- ***Password***: user's password.

On the bottom to the right we can see the version of Krill we are using at the momento.

::: tip
In the next versions google is going to be available to be used as a log in method.
